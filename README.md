*ALX school - AUGUST 2022 Cohort 9*



## Synopsis



This project uses the C programming language to recreate some sorting algorithms. Notably, 0. Bubble sort, 1. Insertion sort, 2. Selection sort, 3. Quick sort, 4. Shell sort - Knuth Sequence, 5. Cocktail shaker sort, 6. Counting sort, 7. Merge sort.

## What students should learn from this project



- At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain:

	- At least four different sorting algorithms

	- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm

	- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
	
	- What is a stable sorting algorithm
